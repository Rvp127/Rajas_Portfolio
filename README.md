I've been working on the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate through Coursera. This has been a very insightful course that has included Tableau, R programming, SQL and key data analyst terminologies and processes. Below is my walkthrough of Case Study 1 within the course using various tools and methods.
* The project is a part of Google Data Analytics Certification course capstone.
* The scenario involves analysis of the trip data of Cyclistic bike share company.
* Working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships.
* The company provides two pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes called as "casual" riders and annual memberships as "Cyclist" members.
* The company operates in Chicago with around 6000 bicycles at 700 stations.
* Maximizing the number of Cyclist members will be key to future growth as it ensures financial sustainability and customer retention.
